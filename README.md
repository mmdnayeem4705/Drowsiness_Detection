## 🎯 Objective

The system is designed to monitor driver drowsiness and raise alarms when the eyes remain closed for a certain duration. This enhances road safety by alerting drowsy drivers and optionally notifying emergency contacts.

---

## 💡 Features

✅ Real-time eye tracking using webcam  
✅ Detects prolonged eye closure  
✅ 3 warning beep alerts + final alarm  
✅ Plays alert sound through browser  
✅ Flask-based web dashboard  
✅ Emergency handler with GPS & email (optional)  
✅ Webcam & pre-recorded video input support  
✅ Team profile section included

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mmdnayeem4705/Eye_Tracking_using_predefined_dataset.git
cd Eye_Tracking_using_predefined_dataset-main
````

2. **Set up virtual environment (optional)**

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Ensure Haarcascade files are placed correctly:**

* `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`
* `haarcascade_eye.xml`

Download from: [https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades)
Place them inside the `haarcascade/` directory.

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open your browser and go to:

## 📸 Screenshots

| Eye Detection      | ![eye](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/...)     |
| Drowsiness Warning | ![warning](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/...) |
| Final Alert        | ![final](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/...)   |

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Face and eye detection** using Haarcascade models.
2. Eye closed for a threshold duration triggers **beep alert** (3 times).
3. If still closed, a **final warning sound** is played.
4. (Optional) Sends location & email alert for emergency.
5. Live feed is rendered in the browser using Flask stream.

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

* ✅ Replace Haarcascades with **MediaPipe Face Mesh**
* ✅ Add **YOLOv5** or custom CNN model for better detection
* 📧 Use Twilio / SMTP for emergency SMS/email
* 📊 Log events (drowsiness time, duration, GPS)
* 📱 Make responsive for mobile dashboard view
* 🔒 Add user login system (for driver reports)

If you want, I can:
- Add badges (e.g., built with Flask, OpenCV)
- Create the `requirements.txt` for you
- Help you host it online (on Render or PythonAnywhere)
- Embed video demos directly in the README

Would you like those as well?
